# CRS key directory

You can put a real CRS file here, by downloading it from:

```shell
curl  https://storage.googleapis.com/matterlabs-setup-keys-us/setup-keys/setup_compact.key --output setup_compact.key
```

We don't include it in github, as it is around 4GB in size.

TODO:
In theory we only use 1/4 of this, so we could create a smaller file.
